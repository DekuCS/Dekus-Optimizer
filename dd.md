## How to Build from Source? (Simple)
1. Hold shift + Right click and click Open Powershell window.
2. type "cd .\QuickBoost" without the quotes obvously
3. run the following command to build a non-compressed .exe file:

dotnet publish -c Release -o publish -p:PublishReadyToRun=true -p:PublishSingleFile=true --self-contained true -p:IncludeNativeLibrariesForSelfExtract=true

or this one for a smaller compressed .exe:

dotnet publish -c Release -o publish -p:PublishReadyToRun=true -p:PublishSingleFile=true --self-contained true -p:IncludeNativeLibrariesForSelfExtract=true -p:EnableCompressionInSingleFile=true 

now its in the QuickBoost\publish Folder.
